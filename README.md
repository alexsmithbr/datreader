# datreader
A simple tool to read Clarion Database files and dump its contents.

This is not a complete project. I made it available to help people needing to deal with these old Clarion Database files.

I needed it to migrate an old genealogy software data to the GEDCOM standard, so I could use it with newer softwares.

The old software was CTREE (Cumberland Tree) and I wanted to use its data with Family Search.

If you need information on the code, drop me a line.

# Install

I used Anjuta to build the project, but you can probably start with:

$ ./configure
$ make

Good luck.

Alex.
